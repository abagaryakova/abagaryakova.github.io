            <b> The Lefties </b>

            My name is John Lefty. I am the world's only left handed piccolo player and Im ready to rock and get wild. You should book our band. We have a drummer and 2 piccolos. I have no idea what else you could possibly want from us. We are trying our hardest. So yeah you're gonna feel pretty bad now huh you better buy all our albums.
